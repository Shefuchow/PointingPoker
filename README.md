# Introduction 
As a team we are looking to optimize and enhance our workflow as a high performing software delivery team.
We're using our planning inovation sprint to develop an Angular/.NET Core Planning Poker Project.
This is to relieve the pain point of story estimation, also allowing developers 
and new TDPs to learn by doing.

# Getting Started
1.	Clone our [Pointing-Poker Repo](https://dev.azure.com/adomtb/DigitalBankingNextGen/_git/Pointing-Poker)
`git clone https://dev.azure.com/adomtb/DigitalBankingNextGen/_git/Pointing-Poker`
2.	We are using
- [Angular for frontend](https://angular.io/)
- [ASP.NET Core for backend](https://github.com/aspnet/Home)
- [Visual Studio Code as our IDE](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
3. Go to our front end directory `cd .\PointingPoker\PointingPoker.AngularFrontend\frontend\`
4. Run `npm ci` (Make sure to have run DigitalBanking.Infastructure before this and set up artifactory)
5. Run our Pointing-Poker solution in Visual Studio 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `wwwroot` directory of our backend. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
